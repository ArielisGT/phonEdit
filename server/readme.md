## METALLICA PROJECT

## DESCRIPTION
 
 This is our third project that consists on creating an app themed of Metallica band. Our main idea is to display an interactive application where the user can check Metallica's discograhpy and choose their favorite album collection. Once the album is selected you can read lyrics and listen the songs.
 Also, it is possible to add a favorite user playlist which enable to user to create and remove tracks in it.
